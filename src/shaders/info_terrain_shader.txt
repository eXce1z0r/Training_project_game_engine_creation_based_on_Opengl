in - variables by which we put info into shader
out - variables which values we returns as a result
sampler2D - variables which used to get images(binded to GL13.GL_TEXTURE)
uniform - variables which can be changed from a programm at time when it works

BOTH:
	-amountOfLightSourcesForOneVertex - is used to store amount of light sources which affect on vertex color and triangle at all. If we want to shange amount of affecting light sources we need change "amountOfLightSourcesForOneVertex" at "terrainVertexShader", "terrainFragmentShader" and "MAX_LIGHTS" at "TerrainShader".

vertexShader, terrainVertexShader:
	-all "out" variables going to fragmentShader

	-position - position of object vertex at 3d space

	-textureCoords - used to store current vertex coordinates(x,y,z) by which will getting color for current vertex from point at texture with coordinates x,y,z

	-lightPosition[n] - stores array of light sources positions. "n"- is amount of light sources. This "n" must be equals "n" at toLightVector[n]

	-density - thickness of fog which hide entities which located further than rendering distance(on the maximum, fog becames very thick so rendering distance decreasing)

	-gradient - determines how quickly visibility decreasing with distance(on the maximum, positions of hided and visible objects very close)

	-surfaceNormal - vertex normal
		calculating:
			surfaceNormal = (transformationMatrix * vec4(normal, 0.0)).xyz;// we makeing from normal 4d matrix like a transformationMatrix to multiply them 				and then get from result of their multiply x,y,z dimensions

			inverse(a); - return inverted value of "a" if it was 1 then it returns -1 and if "a" was equal to -1 then it return 1
			(inverse(viewMatrix) * vec4(0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0)).xyz - we multiplying to make result of inversing of viewMatrix 4d and get just values of x,y and z axis
			
	-visibility - using for count visibility of each vertex based on it's distance from the camera(-distance)
		calculating: 
			clamp(a,b,c) - used for retain value of "a" between "b" and "c"	
	
	-distance - length between vector from camera to current object

	-useFakeLighting - where we should or shouldn't use fake lighting.
					To solve ploblen of making more realistic lightning for transparency object. Where the normals of this objects separated from lightning normals by transparent wall. SOLVING THIS PROBLEM BY DIRECTING NORMALS TO THE TOP
					
	-actualNormal - current normal which should use with the object.
					Can be normal of fake(read about fake lighting from "useFakeLighting").
		calculating:
			if(useFakeLighting > 0.5)//"0"- disable fake lightning,		"1"- activate fake lighting 
			{
				actualNormal = vec3(0.0, 1.0, 0.0);//directing normals to the top
			}
